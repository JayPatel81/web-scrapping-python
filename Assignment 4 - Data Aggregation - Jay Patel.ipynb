       "['“By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It’s Columbus meet Columbo―starry-eyed explorers and skeptical detectives.”',\n",
       " '“‘Possessed’ is probably the right word. I often tell people, ‘I don’t want to necessarily be a data scientist. You just kind of are a data scientist. You just can’t help but look at that data set and go, ‘I feel like I need to look deeper. I feel like that’s not the right fit.’”',\n",
       " '“I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement, generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate the results and take action…. If you just use the scientific method as a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think you’re more apt to be successful with your outcome.”',\n",
       " '“As a data scientist, I can predict what is likely to happen, but I cannot explain why it is going to happen. I can predict when someone is likely to attrite, or respond to a promotion, or commit fraud, or pick the pink button over the blue button, but I cannot tell you why that’s going to happen. And I believe that the inability to explain why something is going to happen is why I struggle to call ‘data science’ a science.”',\n",
       " '“Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary.”',\n",
       " '“Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.”',\n",
       " '“As data scientists, our job is to extract signal from noise.”',\n",
       " '“The job of the data scientist is to ask the right questions. If I ask a question like ‘how many clicks did this link get?’ which is something we look at all the time, that’s not a data science question. It’s an analytics question. If I ask a question like, ‘based on the previous history of links on this publisher’s site, can I predict how many people from France will read this in the next three hours?’ that’s more of a data science question.”',\n",
       " '“A data scientist does model-driven analyses of our data; analyzes to improve our planning, increase our productivity, and develop our deeper levels of subject matter expertise. A data scientist works at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, sharing insights with the business.”',\n",
       " '“[Data scientists are] able to think of ways to use data to solve problems that otherwise would have been unsolved, or solved using only intuition.”',\n",
       " '“What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosity…. The biggest question in data science is ‘Why?’ Why is this happening? If you notice that there’s a pattern, ask, “Why?” Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.”',\n",
       " '“There is a saying, ‘A jack of all trades and a master of none.’ When it comes to being a data scientist you need to be a bit like this, but perhaps a better saying would be, ‘A jack of all trades and a master of some.’”',\n",
       " '“My number one piece of advice always is to follow your passions first. Know what you are good at and what you care about, and pursue that…. As a successful data scientist, your day can begin and end with you counting your blessings that you are living your dream by solving real-world problems with data.”',\n",
       " '“The No. 1 thing is you’ve got to have passion. This rich passion for going ruthlessly after the problem and being deeply intellectually honest with yourself about whether this is a reasonable answer….',\n",
       " '“Nobody ever talks about motivation in learning. Data science is a broad and fuzzy field, which makes it hard to learn. Really hard. Without motivation, you’ll end up stopping halfway through and believing you can’t do it, when the fault isn’t with you―it’s with the teaching.',\n",
       " '“I do not know how you teach someone to love to learn, but being self-motivated is integral to this field. Once you have the core concepts, to be able to be really excited about, and continue to seek out, new information is something that I look for, for example, when we are recruiting people.”',\n",
       " '“You can best learn data mining and data science by doing, so start analyzing data as soon as you can! However, don’t forget to learn the theory, since you need a good statistical and machine learning foundation to understand what you are doing and to find real nuggets of value in the noise of big data.”',\n",
       " '“Learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it.”',\n",
       " '“Data science’s learning curve is formidable. To a great degree, you will need a degree, or something substantially like it, to prove you’re committed to this career….',\n",
       " '“In my view, success for data science professionals relies on becoming trained and able data scientists with the ability to perform data processing and computation at a massive scale. To achieve this, professionals must invest time in ongoing education through institutions with multidisciplinary programs that include elements from engineering, mathematical sciences, and social sciences. Converting big data into meaningful information begins with skilled professionals who are educated in all disciplines to be both data scientists and statisticians.”',\n",
       " '“There is no bottleneck for data scientists… The bottleneck is very often for companies who don’t have a culture of working with data to actually cut down the process into the right steps.”',\n",
       " '“Once you have a certain amount of math/stats and hacking skills, it is much better to acquire a grounding in one or more subjects than in adding yet another programming language to your hacking skills, or yet another machine learning algorithm to your math/stats portfolio…. Clients will rather work with some data scientist A who understands their specific field than with another data scientist B who first needs to learn the basics―even if B is better in math/stats/hacking.”',\n",
       " '“Being a data scientist is not only about data crunching. It’s about understanding the business challenge, creating some valuable actionable insights to the data, and communicating their findings to the business.”',\n",
       " '“Without a grounding in statistics, a Data Scientist is a Data Lab Assistant.”',\n",
       " '“Having skills in statistics, math, and programming is certainly necessary to be a great analytic professional, but they are not sufficient to make a person a great analytic professional.”',\n",
       " '“Talented data scientists leverage data that everybody sees; visionary data scientists leverage data that nobody sees.”',\n",
       " '“What makes a good scientist great is creativity with data, skepticism and good communication skills. Getting all of that together in the same person is difficult―because traditionally, different people follow different paths in their careers―some are more technical, others are more creative and communicative. A data scientist has to have both.”',\n",
       " '“Good data science is exactly the same [as] good science…. Good data science will never be measured by the terabytes in your Cassandra database, the number of EC2 nodes your jobs is using, or the volume of mappers you can send through a Hadoop instance. Having a lot of data does not license you to have a lot to say about it.”',\n",
       " '“Critical thinking skills…really [set] apart the hackers from the true scientists, for me…. You must must MUST be able to question every step of your process and every number that you come up with.”',\n",
       " '“How do we start to regulate the mathematical models that run more and more of our lives? I would suggest that the process begin with the modelers themselves. Like doctors, data scientists should pledge a Hippocratic Oath, one that focuses on the possible misuses and misinterpretations of their models.”',\n",
       " '“With too little data, you won’t be able to make any conclusions that you trust. With loads of data you will find relationships that aren’t real… Big data isn’t about bits, it’s about talent.”',\n",
       " '“Data analysts who don’t organize their transformation pipelines often end up not being able to repeat their analyses, so the advice I would give to myself is the same advice often given to traditional scientists: make your experiments repeatable!”',\n",
       " '“Great data scientists never assume they know something without in-depth analysis, they think in hypotheses which need to be either rejected or proved, and they ask a lot of questions, even if they are 99.9% sure they know the answer.”',\n",
       " '“For me, data science is a mix of three things: quantitative analysis (for the rigor necessary to understand your data), programming (so that you can process your data and act on your insights), and storytelling (to help others understand what the data means).”',\n",
       " '“The difference between a great [data scientist] and a good one is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.”',\n",
       " '“The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning…. Data-driven predictions can succeed―and they can fail. It is when we deny our role in the process that the odds of failure rise. Before we demand more of our data, we need to demand more of ourselves.”',\n",
       " '“One of the big challenges of being a data scientist that people might not usually think about – is that the results or the insights you come up with have to make sense and be convincing. The more intelligible you can make them, the more likely it is that your recommendations will be put into effect.”',\n",
       " '“A data scientist must possess the knack of being able to ‘identify business value from mathematical models.’ But that vital business value can only materialize if the data scientist also networks with other departments, understands their objectives, is familiar with their data and processes – and can spot the analysis options they provide.”',\n",
       " '“People like simple explanations for complex phenomena. If you work as a data scientist, or if you are planning to become/hire one, you’ve probably seen storytelling listed as one of the key skills that data scientists should have. Unlike ‘real’ scientists that work in academia and have to explain their results mostly to peers who can handle technical complexities, data scientists in industry have to deal with non-technical stakeholders who want to understand how the models work. However, these stakeholders rarely have the time or patience to understand how things truly work. What they want is a simple hand-wavy explanation to make them feel as if they understand the matter―they want a story, not a technical report.”',\n",
       " '“You need to be able to take a dataset and discover and communicate what’s interesting about it for your users. To turn this into a product requires understanding how to turn one-off analysis into something reliable enough to run day after day, even as the data evolves and grows, and as different users experience different aspects of it.”',\n",
       " '“We should expect a ‘Big Data 2.0’ phase to follow ‘Big Data 1.0’. Once firms have become capable of processing massive data in a flexible fashion, they should begin asking: ‘What can I do that I couldn’t do before, or do better than I could do before?’ This is likely to be the golden era of data science.”',\n",
       " '“As the field grows, keep an open mind and evolve with it. Work hard, think outside the box, and learn as much as you can about the technical side of being a data scientist. Be responsible with the data and realize the potential the data can have to solving problems. Always ask yourself how the data can be used to positively impact the lives around you, and use that to guide your design and development.”']"
